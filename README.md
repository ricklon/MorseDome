MorseDome
=========

A MorseCode interactive geodesic dome with replaceable modules

The goal is to create a multiple sided dome that can light up, vibrate, and generate morse code.

Each face would have a display that shows the letter/number this would be highledted by some kind of led.

The input would be a piezo that can detect vibrations and light or vibrate the correct display panel.

Another option would be to press the letters and send a vibrating morse code message back.
